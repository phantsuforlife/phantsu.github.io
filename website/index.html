<h4 class="b">After a long year in League of Legends, some people left for various reasons. Some found religion, others switched to Overwatch 2, a few became inactive, and some took breaks, even during matches. With each new year, Riot Games tends to introduce overdue changes. Now, League of Legends is over 13 years old, and Season 13 brings significant updates to the game. The developers are making changes to nearly every part of the game. Given that, we made a guide for players who are still here and want to climb up the ranked ladder for League of Legends season 13.</h4>

    </div>
    
    <h4 class="b crazyword">Applying our tips for climbing in League of Legends‚Äò ranked mode is pointless without staying updated with the meta. Without paying attention to what changes are made, you may be going into a match thinking how your opponents used to think one year ago. With counter picks playing such a huge role in who wins and who loses, the victory could be secured as early as the champion select stage. It is vital to check how the update is going to affect your main champion. Maybe pay your second main if they have been hit too harshly by nerfs, or even buffs to their counter. 
<br><br>
    Essentially, how this looks in the game is Jayce, who was once the single over-powered top layer, now being one of the weakest picks. You may also want to think carefully about taking recently nerfed Ryze and Lee Sin to the top. Kayle, Quinn and Shen have been consistently dominating their lane, and are formidable opponents to the weaker Jayce now.

        <div class="tips_1" id="2">2. BE COMFORTABLE </div></div>
    
    <h4 class="b crazyword">One of the simplest tips for climbing ranked mode in League of Legends is to be comfortable. While Sejuani may be an OP pick for the jungle of League right now, you may just not like her kit. Certain champions are easier than others. One of the simplest champions is Garen. Yuumi has even been the centre of controversy for her supposedly allowing players to passively bag wins. Pulling off in a finger breaking Akali combo may be satisfying. Nonetheless, it may be easier to start with a much simpler champion, before risking a more difficult pick. </h4>

        <h4 class="b crazyword">We all have mains. I‚Äôm Jhin main. While I can confirm we do a lot more than sweeping our noses between the QWE keys, I simply use him because he is fun. I can have a great time dealing damage for my team in stand off‚Äôs for the drake and helping knock down towers. However, I recently tried my hand at the top lane. Initially, I was apprehensive about going one v one against Sett. However, I found Gwen‚Äôs tremendous attack speed and life-stealing abilities to be a simpler than expected tool for securing kills. There is no harm in trying something new in an unranked or Aram game. You might even find your new main. </h4>

        <div class="tips_1" id="4">4. PRO-TIP:VISION IS THE KEY</div></div></div>
    
    <h4 class="b crazyword">In my early days of playing League of Legends, I found my team begging for vision. While the majority of items passively buff us, vision items require you to actively place wards. We received new wards each time we recall. Therefore, an essential tip is to plant all of your wards before recalling. While this tip mostly applies to support players, we should all aim to ward more. Ward your lane, ward the drake and stock up on control wards!

        <img src="jax.jpg" class="image_2" id="5">
        <div class="tips_1">5. LEARN GOOD MATCHUPS</div></div></div>
    
    <h4 class="b crazyword">The next tip for climbing in League is to learn how to play a good matchup. Support champions mostly fall into two of the following categories: melee engage supports and ranged supports. For example, Leona uses her E, Q combo to engage in a close combat brawl. Lux, on the other hand, is a range support, using her snare and slowing abilities to secure gold for her team. The key to ensuring a good match up is to know how to optimise the kit of the champions on your team. For melee engage supports, it is essential to only engage in combat when their ADC has a considerable amount of HP. Starting a fight when your ADC is at 20% health, is a sure way to feed your enemies.¬†
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, an ADC should be focusing on themselves and their support hitting level three, while conserving health and mana, before engaging in a two v two. For example, an Alistar using abilities before level three will only cause him to lose health and mana, with no payoff. For Alistar to secure early wins, he and his ADC must conserve health to stand a fighting chance at an early standoff.
